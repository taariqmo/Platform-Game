To complete the game, you have to get the flag at the end of each level. After you complete every level, you win. In the last level, there is a secret key, that unlocks a bonus level. Also, there will be powerups and coins in every level. Control your character by using W, A, and D, or by using the arrow keys. Press space to shoot a bullet out of your character's gun. You have three lives, represented by a miniature player in the top left, and you have 3 health, represented by a miniature heart in the top left. If you run out of health, you die. If you fall off the course, you die. You lose health by hitting the enemies. Good luck on mastering the game!
